To play the game, copy and paste this code into a Python environment and run it. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100, and you need to guess it within as few attempts as possible.

Feel free to modify and enhance the game as you like. You can add more features, such as keeping track of high scores or customizing the range of numbers.
